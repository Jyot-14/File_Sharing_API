Hello everyone, Good morning

My name is Jyot Vadalia, and I am here to share a story of my life's journey. I come from a small village called Maliya Hatina, but I now reside in Ahmedabad. My father is a hardworking businessman, while my mother is a dedicated housewife. I also have a loving sister who is happily married.

Mathematics has always been my favorite subject. During my free time I find my comfort in playing video games with friends like online team games and watching some web-series. Currently, as a Node.js trainee at Techify, I am excited to explore the world of technology and expand my knowledge. Additionally, I have a keen interest in travel and driving. Exploring new places and hitting the road fills me with a sense of adventure.

From village schooling to studying at Sarthak Vidhya School, Ahmedabad for my higher secondary education and completing my graduation at Gandhinagar Institute of Technology, education has been a driving force in my life.

I want to tell you that my life has always revolved around street knowledge which i got from my father and general knowledge from my learnings based on which this helped to support my family with whatever I can and now, with education, passion, and exploration I want to achieve my dreams. Each step has shaped me into the person I am today, and I am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way.

Thank you everyone for your attention.
